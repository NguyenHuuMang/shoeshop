   "The 'S' in Triple S stands for sole. In other words, this shoe has three of them. Molds were taken from a running shoe, a basketball shoe and track shoe, which were then stacked to create the 6.5cm platform that gives the Triple S both its unique look and its name.",

      "Bruce Kilgore designed the shoe, the name is a reference to Air Force One, the plane that carries the President of the United States.

      "The Air Jordan IV released in 1989 and was produced in four colorways throughout the year. Basically following the same colorway schemes as the Air Jordan III, the IV released in two white-based Bulls colorways (White/Cement and â€œFire Red), one black-based colorway (Black/Red), and a white and blue accented version (Military Blue). It retailed for $100, making it one of the most expensive basketball shoes on the market at the time. But it was worth it, right?",

    description:
      "Let's go back to 1991. The company has been talking for some time about the possibility of producing a sneaker with a more minimal design, 'with the bare essentials'. The right idea came to Tinker Hatfield (already the author of best-sellers like the Air Max 1, Air Max 90 and Jordan III) while he was on water-skis when, after a fall, he noticed how the neoprene sock he was wearing fit particularly well on his foot. Back in the studio, he began to develop a project for an unusual silhouette, consisting of a sort of boot covered with an exoskeleton and without a heel cushion, but with, instead of the solid support, a strap similar to a sandal. Enthusiastic, the man showed his sketches to his colleague Sandy Bodecker who commented on Tinker's work by writing the phrase 'Sneaker of the Gods' on the paper, explaining that they reminded him of the shoes worn by Greek gods. Inspired, Hatfield decided to call his creation after the name of the most famous Mexican sandal: Harrachi (later adapted into Huarache). ",
